To run the game go to "Main.java"

This project applies some of the OOP and datastructure concepts I learned.

I made a simple ai that can play 1 on 1 basketball using methods from the random class, I added attributes to modify the players actions to simulate a real 1v1 basketball game

all files are found in folder "gameFiles"
